1, Abstraction ---------------

Abstraction is a concept in which 
a class has methods without implementation. 
The idea is to have a template 
and let the child class that inherits 
the parent class implement the method.

abstract class Person
{
    public $name;
    abstract protected function Info($n);
}

class Dr extends Person
{
    public function Info($n)
    {
        $this->name = $n;
        return $this->name;
    } 
}

$Dr = new Dr;
echo $Dr->Info("Anik");

2, Encapsulation ---------------

xxxxxxx

3, Inheritance ---------------

class Manager {

}

class Manager extends Employe{

}

4, Polymorphism ---------------

Encapsulation can be used 
if the properties of the object are private 
and updating them through public methods.
